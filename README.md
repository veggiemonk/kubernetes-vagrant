# Kubernetes Vagrant

Spin up a single kubernetes node in a VM and use kubectl to manage it.

Based on [this article](https://medium.com/@lizrice/kubernetes-in-vagrant-with-kubeadm-21979ded6c63) written by [Liz Rice](https://github.com/lizrice)

This repo will try to automate things in order to provide fast feedback when testing something on kubernetes.

Feedback and contributions are more than welcome.
